    <string name="about_text">\
<b>Sudoku</b> is a logic-based number placement puzzle.
Starting with a partially completed 9x9 grid, the
objective is to fill the grid so that each
row, each column, and each of the 3x3 boxes
(also called <i>blocks</i>) contains the digits
1 to 9 exactly once.<p>Completed games are always a type of Latin square
            with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions.
            For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column, or any of the nine 3Ã—3 subregions of the 9x9 playing board.</p></string>
